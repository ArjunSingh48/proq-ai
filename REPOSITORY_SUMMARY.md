## 📋 Project Overview

**Overdrive** is a supplier ranking and procurement validation engine developed for the ChainIQ START Hack 2026. It processes procurement requests and returns ranked supplier shortlists with policy evaluation, pricing analysis, escalation triggers, and audit trails.

**Core Purpose:** Automate supplier selection for procurement by scoring suppliers against multiple criteria (risk, quality, ESG, preference status) and validating decisions against historical awards data.

## 🔧 Core Components

### 1. **supplier_engine.py** — Main Processing Engine
   - **Class:** `SupplierEngine`
   - **Purpose:** Processes a procurement request and returns a ranked supplier shortlist
   - **Key Functions:**
     - Load supplier, pricing, policy, and award data
     - Parse request (category, budget, quantity, country, requirements)
     - Filter suppliers (policy compliance, data residency, capability)
     - Score suppliers using weighted combination of:
       - `risk_score` (0–100) — supplier risk profile
       - `quality_score` (0–100) — quality metrics
       - `esg_score` (0–100) — environmental/social/governance performance
       - `is_preferred` — policy-preferred flag
       - `is_incumbent` — current supplier flag
       - `is_mentioned` — explicitly requested flag
     - Flag escalations (budget issues, policy violations, risk thresholds)
     - Return ranked shortlist with audit trail

   - **Usage:**
     ```python
     from supplier_engine import SupplierEngine
     engine = SupplierEngine()
     result = engine.process(request_dict)
     # Or: python supplier_engine.py  →  writes outputs.json
     ```

   - **Key Mapping:** Country → Region for pricing lookup
     - EU (default), CH, Americas (US/CA/BR/MX), APAC (AU/SG/JP/IN), MEA (UAE/ZA)

### 2. **fit_scoring_weights.py** — ML Weight Optimization
   - **Method:** Pairwise logistic regression (Bradley-Terry model)
   - **Input:** Historical awards CSV (training data)
   - **Output:** `scoring_weights.json` with optimized coefficients
   - **Approach:**
     - For each request with historical award, create (awarded, competitor) pairs
     - Compute feature differences: `diff = features(awarded) - features(competitor)`
     - Fit logistic regression: `P(awarded > competitor) = sigmoid(w · diff)`
     - Positive coefficient = awarded tends to have HIGHER value → subtract in scoring
     - Negative coefficient = awarded tends to have LOWER value → add in scoring

   - **Performance (from scoring_weights.json):**
     - CV Accuracy: 96.2% (±3.5%)
     - Ranking Accuracy: 95.2% (vs 31.2% baseline)
     - +121 correctly ranked requests

### 3. **validate_engine.py** — Historic Validation
   - **Purpose:** Run supplier engine over all requests and compare against historical_awards.csv
   - **Comparison Dimensions:**
     1. `winner_match` — Our rank-1 == historically awarded?
     2. `winner_in_shortlist` — Awarded supplier in our shortlist?
     3. `escalation_match` — Did we flag escalations iff history says needed?
     4. `status_vs_awarded` — If awarded in history, status ≠ cannot_proceed?
   - **Output:**
     - Console: summary table + disagreement breakdown
     - `validate_report.json`: machine-readable results

### 4. **escalation_stats.py** — Escalation Analysis
   - **Purpose:** Confusion matrix analysis for escalation decisions
   - **Matrix:**
     ```
                        History: escalated | History: not escalated
     We: escalated      TP                | FP
     We: not escalated  FN                | TN
     ```
   - **Metrics:** Precision, Recall, F1, Accuracy, Specificity
   - **Breakdowns:** FPs by rule fired, FNs by historical escalation reason
   - **Output:** Console + detailed JSON report

2. **Feature Extraction:** For each request, extract supplier features (risk, quality, ESG, preferred, incumbent, mentioned)
3. **Pairwise Training:** Create (awarded, non-awarded) pairs and compute feature differences
4. **Logistic Regression:** Fit model to learn which features drive winning decisions
5. **Fitted Weights:** Output coefficients that optimize ranking accuracy (31.2% → 95.2%)
6. **Integration:** Drop fitted weights into supplier_engine.py for production scoring

## ✅ Validation Metrics

- **Winner Match:** Does our rank-1 recommendation match historical award?
- **Shortlist Rate:** Is historical award within our top-N shortlist?
- **Escalation Precision:** Do we flag escalations when history says needed? (Avoid false alarms)
- **Escalation Recall:** Do we catch all historical escalations?
- **Overall Accuracy:** Consensus across all four validation dimensions
